# AWS EKS Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform

This guide outlines the process for deploying an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster using Terraform. It's designed for users with basic knowledge of AWS and Terraform, enabling them to deploy and manage the necessary resources efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account**: Create an account at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- **Terraform**: Install the Terraform CLI from [Terraform's website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- **AWS CLI**: Install from [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
- **kubectl**: Required for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster. Install from [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

## Configuration

### Step 1: Configure AWS CLI

Set up your AWS CLI with the appropriate credentials: 


Step 2: Clone the Repository
git clone https://your-repository-url.com/path/to/repo.git
cd your-repository-name

Step 3: Set Up S3 Backend for Terraform State

Create an S3 bucket for storing Terraform state:

Log into AWS Console
Navigate to S3 service
Create a new bucket with a unique name
Enable versioning on the bucket


Create a DynamoDB table for state locking:

Navigate to DynamoDB in AWS Console
Create a new table named terraform-state-lock (or your preferred name)
Use LockID as the partition key


Update the backend.tf file with your S3 bucket and DynamoDB table details:

hclCopyterraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "YOUR_AWS_REGION"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
Replace YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME and YOUR_AWS_REGION with your actual values.
Step 4: Initialize Terraform
Initialize the Terraform working directory:
terraform init
Step 5: Review the Terraform Plan
Generate and review the execution plan:
terraform plan

Step 6: Deploy the Infrastructure
Apply the Terraform configuration to create the EKS cluster:
terraform apply

Post-Deployment
After successful deployment:

Configure kubectl to interact with your new EKS cluster:

aws eks --region <your-region> update-kubeconfig --name <your-cluster-name>

Verify the cluster connection:

kubectl get nodes
Cleanup
To avoid ongoing charges, remember to destroy the resources when they're no longer needed:
terraform destroy
Security Note

Ensure that your AWS credentials are kept secure and not shared or committed to version control.
The S3 bucket for Terraform state should have appropriate access controls and encryption enabled.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

Check AWS Console for error messages or resource status.
Review Terraform logs for detailed error information.
Ensure your IAM user/role has necessary permissions for EKS and related services.

For more detailed information on EKS and Terraform, refer to the official documentation:

Amazon EKS Documentation
This README now focuses on EKS deployment, includes information about setting up the S3 backend for Terraform state, and provides a more comprehensive guide for users. It covers the entire process from prerequisites to post-deployment steps and includes important security notes and troubleshooting tips.
